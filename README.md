# Oblivion Vaults (A Minecraft Mods and Settings Manager)

BEFORE I START!!, IM LAZY AT GUI DESIGNING SO DONT BLAME ME THAT IT LOOKS LIKE SOME 1985 SOFTWARE :(
Atleast I made good use of emojis to keep it from looking "Terminally"

_________________________________________________________
Stop letting your 1.12 mods crash your 1.20 game T-T... OBLIVION is a standalone, aesthetic-focused instance manager for Minecraft. It doesn't just launch the game; it surgically removes your mods, settings, and worlds, locks them in a secure "Vault," and swaps them out instantly. No more manual folder dragging. No more corrupted files Aiit? U-U

🔮 OBLIVION -
OBLIVION is a standalone, aesthetic-focused instance manager for Minecraft. It doesn't just launch the game; it surgically removes your mods, settings, and worlds, locks them in a secure "Vault," and swaps them out instantly. No more manual folder dragging. No more corrupted chunks. (I think I already said that...)

☕ Why you need this as a Modded Java Player
Minecraft launchers are great, but sometimes they share too much. You change your sensitivity in 1.8 PvP, and suddenly your 1.20 survival camera is flying all over the place. You accidentally open your main world in an old version? Gone. 💀 (I think that was a good example)
OBLIVION fixes this by creating completely isolated environments for every version you play. It manages the chaos so you don't have to.

⚡ Features...
🛡️ Total Isolation: Keep your mods, options.txt, servers.dat, and saves completely separate.

🧬 Smart Cloning: One-click to clone your current setup into a new Vault.

🎨 Custom Aesthetics: Built-in Theme Engine with a Color Wheel and Background Picker. Make it pink, make it void-black, make it yours.

🎧 Sound System (not really cool): Upload your own .wav or .mp3 files for custom click, hover, and launch sounds. (ASMR compatible? Maybe.)

📂 Utility Mode: Open vault folders instantly or mass-delete old profiles with "Manage Mode."

👶 Baby-Proof Tooltips (yes, you read that right): Confused? Click the (?) for a simple, roasted explanation of what it does.




🛠️ How it Works I guess:
Forge a Vault: Select what you want to protect (Mods? Saves? Options?).

Launch: Oblivion automatically backs up your current .minecraft files to a temp folder and injects your Vault files.

Play: Go crazy. Break stuff. It doesn't matter.

Undo: When you're done, click the "🛑 UNDO button"... Oblivion saves your progress, removes the Vault files, and puts your original files back exactly how they were.
